**Contents**:
- Configuration schema documentation
- Migration strategies for breaking changes
- How to add new configuration options safely
- Security best practices for sensitive data
- Testing patterns for configuration
- Common configuration patterns

**Value**: Ensures configuration changes follow consistent patterns and maintain backward compatibility.

#### internal/executor/CLAUDE.md

**Contents**:
- Command execution security model
- Cross-platform compatibility guide
- Shell detection and handling
- Safety considerations and future improvements
- Error handling patterns

**Value**: Critical security guidance for the most sensitive part of the codebase.

### 2. Enhanced Prompt Engineering

#### Changes to internal/agent/claude.go

**New Functions Added**:
1. `gatherContext()` - Collects environment context for better command generation
2. `summarizeDirectory()` - Creates token-efficient summary of current directory

**Improvements to buildSystemPrompt()**:
- Now includes current working directory
- Adds file type summary (e.g., "5 .go files, 3 .md files")
- Enhanced safety guidelines
- Better structured with clear sections (Environment, Context, Rules, Safety, Examples)
- More comprehensive examples
- Improved formatting for Claude to parse

**Benefits**:
- **Better Accuracy**: Commands are now context-aware (knows what files are present)
- **Smarter Suggestions**: Can infer intent based on directory contents
  - Example: "run tests" → "go test ./..." (when .go files detected)
  - Example: "start server" → "npm start" (when package.json detected)
- **Token Efficient**: Context gathering is optimized to minimize token usage
- **Safer Commands**: Enhanced safety guidelines reduce dangerous command generation

**Example Improvement**:
```
Before:
User: "run tests"
Prompt: Basic system prompt with OS/shell
Result: Generic test command

After:
User: "run tests"
Prompt: System prompt + "Context: Current directory: /project, Files: 15 .go files, 2 .md files"
Result: "go test ./..." (Go-specific command based on context)
```

### 3. Testing Infrastructure Documentation

#### TESTING.md
**Location**: `/TESTING.md`

**Contents**:
- Testing philosophy and pyramid
- Comprehensive test examples for each package
- Table-driven test patterns
- Mock/stub patterns for external dependencies
- CI/CD integration examples
- Coverage goals and measurement
- Best practices and checklist

**Value**: Provides complete blueprint for implementing test suite.

#### Example Test File
**Location**: `/internal/agent/agent_test.go`

**Contents**:
- MockAgent implementation for testing
- Interface compliance tests
- Example usage patterns

**Value**: Demonstrates testing patterns and provides reusable test utilities.

## Specific Optimizations for Future Claude Code Sessions

- Adding new LLM providers (internal/agent/CLAUDE.md)
- Adding configuration options (internal/config/CLAUDE.md)
- Implementing safe command execution (internal/executor/CLAUDE.md)

**Quality Improvement**: Consistent patterns, fewer mistakes

### 3. Better Command Generation

**Before**: Basic prompts with minimal context
**After**:
- Directory-aware prompts
- File-type detection
- Enhanced safety guidelines
- Better examples

**User Experience**: More accurate commands, fewer iterations

### 4. Testing Roadmap

**Before**: No testing infrastructure or patterns
**After**:
- Complete testing guide
- Example test files
- Mock patterns
- CI/CD templates

**Development Speed**: Clear path to implementing tests

## Quantifiable Improvements
